"Layer 4 load balancing to include TCP/UDP source/destination port numbers in addition to source/destination IP addresses in per-flow hashing of IP packets",
"Users can enable Layer 4 load balancing to include TCP/UDP source/destination port numbers in addition to source/destination IP addresses in per-flow hashing of IP packets. By including the Layer 4 information, a SA/DA default hash flow can be sub-divided into multiple finer-granularity flows if the ports used between a specific SA/DA vary. Layer 4 load balancing can be enabled or disabled at the system or interface level to improve load balancing distribution by including the TCP or UDP source and destination port of the packet to the hash function. Use the following command to enable layer 4 load balancing at the system level.",
"The command to enable Layer 4 hashing is 'configure system load-balancing l4-load-balancing'"
